ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @reva1804
I recently graduated from IISER Tirupati with a master's in biology
For my master's thesis, I worked on aquatic insect microbiomes at MPI for Chemical Ecology
I am searching for PhD opportunities in ecology and evolution, emphasizing microbiomes or metabarcoding.
You can reach me on revat@students.iisertirupati.ac.in or reva.t.infnity@gmail.com
